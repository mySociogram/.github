# SocialMesh
SocialMesh is an innovative social media decentralized application (dApp) built on the Fantom Foundation blockchain. Its primary objective is to establish a platform that fosters vibrant communities by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. Here are the key features and functionalities of SocialMesh:

- Community Empowerment: When a community is created on SocialMesh, a billion unique tokens are minted specifically for that community. These tokens play a pivotal role in empowering and gamifying communities.
- Token Utility: The community tokens serve multiple purposes within the SocialMesh ecosystem. Firstly, they determine the voting power for community governance, ensuring that decision-making is fair and representative. Secondly, tokens are used to pay for various services within the community, such as advertising or commerce. Additionally, the tokens can be utilized as a form of payment for services, including jobs and gigs.
- Token Collection: Community tokens can be obtained through a reward system, where tokens are rewarded for providing assistance or engaging content within the community. Furthermore, an in-app marketplace facilitates the buying, loaning, and swapping of tokens, enabling users to acquire tokens through various means.
- Decentralized Communities: In SocialMesh, communities are owned collectively by every member of the community, rather than being controlled solely by the user who created it. This decentralized ownership structure ensures that decision-making power is distributed among community members.
- Autonomous Communities: SocialMesh communities operate autonomously, with no involvement from the SocialMesh team in their governance. This grants communities the freedom to establish their own rules and processes.
- Multiple Community Memberships: Users have the flexibility to be a member of multiple communities simultaneously, allowing them to engage with diverse interests and networks.
- Unique Concept Communities: On the blockchain, there can only be one community for a particular concept. However, sub-communities and cliques can be formed within a community to cater to specific aspects or interests.

Overall, SocialMesh leverages blockchain technology to create an inclusive and engaging social media platform where communities can thrive, enabling users to actively participate, govern, and benefit from their collective experiences.
